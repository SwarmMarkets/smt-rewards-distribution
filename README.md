# smt-rewards-distribution
Documenting SMT rewards policy and distribution history

## Reports
Starting on week 001 of the liquidity mining program (August 1st 2021), pools are incentivized with this program. Each weekly report directory has the following structure:

* __rd_<week>.json folder, containg the rewards files for the corresponding week
* __smt_rd<week>_total.json files, containing the start / end time for the distribution, plus a list of <addresses> of rewards recipients (liquidity providers and traders) and the amount of <token> earned by each

## Weekly distributions
* Based on:
  * the continually updated [SMT - Rewards Distribution - Policy](https://github.com/SwarmMarkets/smt-rewards-distribution/blob/main/policies/smt_rd_policy.md)
  * the weekly distributions based on predefined weekly [SMT rewards release schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13XTheJLsMDjeZUs9HGYUkjN6hA5BtsA-u6oRMrf24Ug/edit#gid=1658174309)
* We anticipate that Ethereum mainnet rewards recipients will have their rewards made claimable to them by Wednesdays the following week at [trade.swarm.markets](https://trade.swarm.markets)
